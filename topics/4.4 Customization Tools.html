        <img src="../images/topicsImages/img4.4.0.png" alt="Figure 4.4.0: CUstomization Tools">
    </div>
    
    <h3>1) Map Name:</h3>
    <p>
        The name of the map that appears on the web browser Tab title.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Map Style:</h3>
    <p>
        The admin can choose between two styles, "Gray Scale", which is the default, and "Blue colored", where the water bodies are presented in blue light color.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Inherit Child Location:</h3>
    <p>
        When this field is enabled, a tag that is parent from another tags will inherit all locations from the children that was not previously declared on the parent. If instead you want to manually declare the locations for all tags, we suggest to keep this field disabled.
    </p>

    <h3>4) Cluster Close Tags:</h3>
    <p>
        When this field is enabled, tags located very close to each other will be grouped in clusters. This mechanism only causes visual effects, not affecting the system behavior.
    </p>    
    
    <h3>5) Initials zoom, latitude and longitude:</h3>
    <p>
        The initial observation point on the map.
    </p>    

    <h3>6) Link feature:</h3>
    <p>
        When this field is enabled, the link feature will be displayed on the front-end.
    </p>
