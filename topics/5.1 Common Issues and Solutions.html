    <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
    <h2>Common Issues and Solutions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>The system was build apparently successfully, because I can open the admin page, but the user page does not open:</p>
            This problem can occur when all the containers of the system are builded successfully, unless the nginx container. You can trying restart the nginx and the front-end containers.
        </li>
        <li><p>The system was instantiated but any admin user was automatically create:</p>
            This problem can happen when the django's admin-creation-module from the backend fails in the initialization. You can solve easily this problem using the backend tools in command line.
            <pre><code>python createadmin "name" "password"</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>
